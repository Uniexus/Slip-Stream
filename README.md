# Slip-Stream
Project slip-stream is an encryption and decryption algorithm that can encrypt a message utilizing a variety of practices. The purpose of this program is to develop my interpretation of an encrypted cipher. The encryption algorithm will work with the decryption, which will allow program users to encrypt a message and send the message with an encryption key to access the contents of the message.
